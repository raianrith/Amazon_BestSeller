Intro : 

Over the years, Amazon has become America’s leading online marketplace for literally anything. One of those products are books. All of us have purchased books from Amazon at least once in our lives. Maybe it was for school; maybe it was a gift; maybe it was actually for ourselves to just read for fun. It’s inevitable; Amazon’s prices are so low and their website is so accessible that it’s logically the best market for a consumer to buy from. So, what kind of books do most people buy? Fictions or Non Fictions? Surely, the Amazon bestsellers are classics like Balzac’s Lives by Peter Brooks or the best Non-Fictions like Silent Spring by Rachel Carson, right? You would be surprised to know that that is not the case. This short blog post answers these questions through a Data Analytic study of a Data set on Amazon’s Top 50 bestselling books from 2009 to 2019. It contains 550 books, in which data has been categorized into fiction and non-fiction using Goodreads. I found this interesting data set on Kaggle at “https://www.kaggle.com/sootersaalu/amazon-top-50-bestselling-books-2009-2019/discussion”.

Conclusion :

Amazon’s best sellers are not necessarily the most popular books of the world. Amazon book consumers tend to buy books which are relatively less expensive and their decision is somewhat influenced by the number of reviews that the books get. Lastly, over the last decade, there have been more Fiction consumers than Non-Fiction consumers who purchased books from Amazon.
